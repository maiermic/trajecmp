## Abstract

I'd like to detect specific movements in 2D and 3D space that are described as trajectories (called patterns).
Input trajectory (recorded movement) and pattern trajectory (description of a specific movement) are preprocessed and
compared by distance to each other. Dependent on the result, a function is called to process the result.

```c++
const auto result_stream =
  compare(preprocess(input_stream),
          preprocess(pattern_stream));

result_stream.subscribe([](auto &&result) {
    // process result
  });
```

### Transformation

A transformation operation is a [Callable][Callable] with signature `Trajectory (const Trajectory &)`.
It might be a functor that depends on input arguments.
For example, `translate_by(vector)` creates a transformation operation that translates a trajectory by `vector` and
returns the result.
